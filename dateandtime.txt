Date and Time
Python is very useful in case of Date and Time. We can easily retrieve current date and time using Python.
Retrieve Time
To retrieve current time a predefined function localtime() is used. localtime() receives a parameter time.time() . Here,

ex:
import time;  
localtime = time.localtime(time.time())  
print ("Current Time is :", localtime)  



Formatted Time
Python also support formatted time. Proceed as follows:
1.	Pass the time structure in a predefined function asctime(). It is a function defined in time module.
2.	It returns a formatted time which includes Day ,month, date, time and year.
3.	Print the formatted time.

ex:import time;  
localtime = time.asctime(time.localtime(time.time()))  
print ("Current Time is :", localtime)  

Calendar
Python provides calendar module to display Calendar.

Ex:
#print particular month
import calendar  
print("Current month is:")  
cal = calendar.month(2024, 5)  
print(cal ) 


#print whole year calander 
import calendar  
calendar.prcal(2024)
